 * square of squares
 * You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. And what you even like more, is to
 * arrange them into a square of square building blocks!
 * However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those
 * blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! That's it! You just
 * have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.
 * Task
 * Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:
 * In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words,
 * it is the product of some integer with itself.
